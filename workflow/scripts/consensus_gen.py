    """
    This takes the path to an aligned file and the name you want the consensus sequence to call called.
    Returns a SeqRecord containg the consensus sequence

    This is differance from consen_gen. As this applies logic to which base is returned in a few ways

    Seq1:               ATGCA-
    Seq2:               ATCC--
    Seq3:               N-----
    Seq4:               N-----

    classic_consen:     N-----
    this_consen:        ATNCNN


    A simple consen_gen would have returned "N---" as "-" is the most common base in each position.
        Expect for the first position where the equal number would trigger an ambiquity char

    This consen discards the gaps (or "N"), enabling genomes with poly N track to be used.
        It can also detect vairability within the valid bases
        If no valid bases are detected it will return "N"

    However it does require, two sequences to generate a base. To prevent point mutations being represented
